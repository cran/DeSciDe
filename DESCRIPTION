Description: Designed for genomic and proteomic data analysis, enabling unbiased PubMed searching, protein interaction network visualization, and comprehensive data summarization. This package aims to help users identify novel targets within their data sets based on protein network interactions and publication precedence of target's association with research context based on literature precedence. Methods in this package are described in detail in: Douglas (Year) <to-be-added DOI or link to the preprint>. Key functionalities of this package also leverage methodologies from previous works, such as:
  - Szklarczyk et al. (2023) <doi:10.1093/nar/gkac1000>
  - Winter (2017) <doi:10.32614/RJ-2017-066>.
